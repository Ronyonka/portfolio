    <p>Hi, I am Ron Onyonka: an aspiring software developer in Nairobi, currently studying at Moringa School.
       I'm still a newbie to the whole coding thing but i've made great strides
       in a short while and I'm still getting better with every single line of code (Watch This Space).
       So far I am moderatly profficient in using HTML and CSS I also kind of sort of have a grasp of JavaScript and Python basics lol!
       This is all in part thanks to <strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nc9n77W42g" target="_blank">Free</a></strong> resources such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/
       " target="_blank">Code Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/
   " target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/
     " target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> and last but not least the good old <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></em> University.</p><br>

    <p>A trivia fact you might want find interesting is, prior to joining the Moringa bootcamp I had no coding experience. I was actually studying for an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry. I guess I have always been curious about the
    internal functioining of things/what makes things work and that may be partly what drove me both to Biochemistry and Programming. It can be considered a career change
  but I would love to merge the two disciplines together if possible.</p><br>
    <p>I am driven by the will to make a difference (and coffee). Social impact is one of the areas that I am really
    passionate in. I believe that we should all be able to leave the earth much better than we found it and that is something
    I strive to do every single day. One of the ways we can achieve that is through technology, hence my interest in programming.</p><br>
    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>Apart from being curious, which so  far hasn't killed this car, I also enjoy a number  of things like(in no particular order):</p><br>
    <ol>
      <li >Sports</li>
        <p>I love playing sports as much as I love watching them. This occupies most of my free time and thoughts.</p>
      <li>Movies</li>
        <p>If I'm not playing/watching sports I'm probably tucked in watching a movie. I'm actually a self declared cinephile,
        wich is someone who is in love with films, film theories and criticism (at least according to my friend google).
        I do love a good film i.e any Christopher Nolan film</p>
      <li>Music</li>
        <p>When it comes to music it's more than love. Whether I'm working out or just working I'd most likely have
        my earphones in. Music really helps me zone out and focus. Do I have a favorite genre? Not really. I'm just obssesed with
       good sound</p>
      <li>Comedy</li>
        <p>I've seperated comedy from movies purposely because comedy exists in more than movies.
         By comedy I refer things that make me laugh, from comedy movies, funny people, stand-up comics and even memes.
         this helps me get through some otherwise tough times with a smile on my face.</p>
      <li>Food</li>
        <p>If you know, you know.</p>
    </ol>
