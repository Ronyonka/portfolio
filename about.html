    <p>Hello once again. Incase you were wondering my name is still Ron Onyonka HELLO: I make work about the things we buy and the feelings we feel. The building blocks of my practice include: bright colors, hand lettering, inventories of illustrated objects, and input and interaction from the communities of awesome people who contribute to my crowd-sourced projects.
Rule based projects RULE my work. Almost all of my non-client work operates some sort of rule structure. The project I might be best know for is my daily purchase drawing project that started in 2006. 12 years and over 3,000 drawings later, it’s still going strong. You may follow along over on my instagram for the latest drawings.
My roles as commercial illustrator, full-time educator, and project-based artist overlap to inform an intricate creative work flow.
My studio is located in Outlet which is my project space located in Portland, Oregon. I am also an Associate Professor of Graphic Design a Portland State. My position as both leader and collaborator with my students is an integral part of my creative practice.
Have questions? Check out a few interviews. Want to work together? Let me know!</p>

    <p>WORK & PLAY: In April of 2017 I moved my studio operations to my new project and workshop space Outlet. The main floor is for workshops, pop-up events, and provides additional space for my larger projects. Barbara the Risograph lives here as well as my ever-growing zine library (I can't stop, won't stop collecting zines). There’s also a collection of art and publishing supplies and other materials for making (happy to share, always).

Upstairs is my private office where I draw for myself and for my clients (and write lots of email and get distracted by social media).

Outlet has open hours almost every day of the week. If you are in Portland, come and check us out at 2500 NE Sandy Boulevard, STE E, Portland, Oregon, 97232 (also, I love mail if you happen to have any zines you would like to share. SUBTLE HINT</p>
